## :medal\_sports: Challenge <a id="challenge"></a>

Develop a web application that works as a meeting management system for an organization. The focus is to ensure that members can access available rooms in hybrid, in-person, and online formats, as well as free time slots for meetings.

<br>

## ðŸš€ MVP <a id="mvp"></a>

<div>
  Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a concise yet functional version of the meeting management software. In it, the user will be able to:

* Schedule in-person, online, and hybrid meetings in a flexible, trackable, and simple way.
* Provide occupancy information for rooms and users.
* Register, edit, and delete users and meeting rooms of all types with their respective constraints.

## :books: Methodology <a id="methodology"></a>

The Agile framework used was Scrumâ€”an adaptive, iterative, flexible, and effective method. Its guiding principles are:

1. *Empirical control*
2. *Self-organization*
3. *Collaboration*
4. *Prioritization of value creation*
5. *Time-boxing*
6. *Iterative development*

Among the tools used in Scrum is breaking the project into **Sprints**. To select the deliverables for our Sprints, we first defined our **MVP**, prioritizing tasks that would bring the greatest value to the client. From these tasks, we built the **Product Backlog**, which was approved by the client and split into 4 Sprint Backlogs.

To support decision-making and prioritize higher-value tasks, we created **Personas**. With them, we had greater clarity in guiding our **User Stories**. With Tasks, Personas, and User Stories outlined, we used **Planning Poker** to estimate the time needed for each task, distributing work more efficiently among the teamâ€™s developers.
